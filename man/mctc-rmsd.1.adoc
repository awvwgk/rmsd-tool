= mctc-rmsd(1)

== Name
mctc-rmsd - Structure comparison by root mean square deviation


== Synopsis
*mctc-rmsd* [_options ] _file_ _file_...


== Description

Requires at least two input files. Supported formats are:
- xyz, mol, sdf, coord (0D), gen (C), pdb

Configuration data is read from `[rmsd]` table in `mctc.toml`.
Just place the configuration file `mctc.toml` (or `.mctc.toml`) in your home directory.
Example:

    [rmsd]
    unit = "AA"
    [rmsd.filter]
    heavy.exclude = [ "H", "h" ]


== Options

*--filter* _name_::
Use _name_ filter from configuration data to apply mask

*--rc*::
Check configuration data and print it to standard out

*--version*::
Print program version and exit

*--help*::
Show this help message


== Filter

Filters can be defined in the `[rmsd.filter]` section, they take a list of
atomic numbers and/or element symbols to define the allow-/deny-list.
For example, to only check all carbon, nitrogen and oxygen atoms create
a filter named organic with:

    organic.include = [6, 7, 8]

Similarly, to create a filter for all heavy elements, effectively just
excluding hydrogen with standard symbols, use:

    heavy.exclude = ["H", "h"]

Note that this approach will still consider deuterium labeled as D,
which would be excluded as well when using the atomic number instead.

To create a PDB specific filter use the four character PDB identifier
of the atoms and enable the PDB functionality.
To match only the proteine backbone use

    backbone.include = [" CA ", " N  ", " C  ", " O  "]
    backbone.pdb = true

Atomic numbers and element symbols can be included here as well.
